You can save them by clicking the star in the top-right corner and later view them listed in the section at the bottom left. You can also click on the detailed map image in the infrastructure section to mark its location on the map.\n*By selecting the \"Go\" option, you'll get directions and references to reach the location based on your proximity to the university through the navigation displayed on the screen. The option to view the map is in the interactive bar at the bottom right corner, where you can center your location and switch between \"Street View\" or \"Satellite View\".\n*To view different options and edit your preferences, press the three buttons at the top right, where you can change font size, theme, language, etc. *Finally, by pressing the profile icon at the top inside the circle with the image, you can change your password or log out.",
